QPlanner by Richard Crook 2012-
  * Aims to be a project planner similar to M$Project with table entry of tasks & gantt chart
  * Also aims to have automatic resource leveling and scheduling based on task priority
  * Also aims to have resource levels variable within single task
  * Also aims to have gantt chart task bar thickness showing this variable resource usage
  * Based on work I started as early as 2005
