#summary Introduction to some of the concepts behind QPlanner.

=Introduction=

==Parameters==

Tasks have a number of parameters, some of which have a state as well as a value.

Examples of parameters that that states as well as a value are:
  * Start - date & time when task starts (not necessarily when allocated resources start spending effort)
  * End - date & time when task ends (not necessarily when allocated resources finish spending effort)
  * Duration - working time period between task start and end based on a calendar
  * Work - time allocated by assigned resources


==States==

Typically there are two states
  # Automatic - i.e. derived by QPlanner from other information enter by the user
  # Fixed - i.e. user entered and defined

==Examples==

===Start===

Default = Automatic
  * Automatic = QPlanner sets value to project start, or after subject to task predecessors (TBC)
  * Fixed = User entered value used to defined date & time task must not start before (TBC)
